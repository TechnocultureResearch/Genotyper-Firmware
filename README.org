** Build an application

To build an application (For example, the TMP100 sensor) using the west tool, navigate to the workspace and run

*** Build

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
west build -p auto -b geno_nrf52811 samples/sensor/tmp100
#+END_SRC

- =-p= ensures a pristine (clean) build.
- =-b= is used to specify the board name.
 
*** Flash
After the build process is completed, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
west flash --erase
#+END_SRC

This will flash the executable file generated onto the flash memory of the target board.

*** Console
The =minicom= serial monitor is needed to view the sensor output on the console.

Run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM* -b 115200
#+END_SRC

- =-D= specifies the device connected to the port.
- =-b= specifies the baudrate of transmission overriding the value mentioned in the minicom's configuration file.
